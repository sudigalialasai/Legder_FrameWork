#       Distributed Ledger FrameWork

 This project aims to develop a distributed ledger framework using Ethereum blockchain to securely store and
manage academic marks. The proposed system offers a decentralized and transparent solution to traditional mark
management systems, which often suffer from security vulnerabilities and data tamperin..The framework will utllize smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to automate the mark storage and verification process..This project involves developing a distributed ledger framework using Ethereum blockchain and integrating it with the Metamask
wallet.

## Abstract

 Create a smart contract in Solidity using Remix IDE,open the Remix IDE in web browser. Once the IDE is opened,
create a new file and give it a name with a ”.sol” extension. Next, start writing smart contract code in the editor
provided by Remix IDE.Once you have written your smart contract code, you can compile it using the Solidity
compiler provided by Remix IDE.Soon after the compilation you will get an ABI(Abstract Binary Interface code).Set the environment to Injected provider metamask in remix IDE and set the network ID to the network ID ofthe metamask and then deploy the code run Transactions section in remix IDE.Soon after deploying the code an Deployed Contracts is created.ou can call functions on a contract, read data from it, and listen to events emitted by it. Make sure that you have installed all required libaries and set connections for running index.py file. Web3.js makes it easy to create and send transactions to the Ethereum network. You can set the gas
limit and gas price for transactions,and monitor their status.Using frontend Interface with web3 we can interact with
the Blockchain. Whenyou opening the frontend Interface makesure that Ganache is opened , index.py code is running and Go Live to open the main.html.For further details read report.pdf.
